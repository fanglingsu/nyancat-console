Coding style
============

The Code is idented by four spaces. For better readability you should put
braces of function blocks in their own line like this.

void do_something(const int counter)
{
    if (counter > 5) {
        fprintf(stdout, "Counter higher than 5");
    } else if {
        /* other code here */
    }
}
