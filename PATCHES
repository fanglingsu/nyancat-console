Coding style
============

The Code is idented by four spaces. For better readability you should put
braces of function blocks in their own line like this.

void do_something(const int counter)
{
    if (counter > 5) {
        fprintf(stdout, "Counter higher than 5");
    } else if {
        /* other code here */
    }
}

If you use 'indent' to reindent your code, following option would fit our style.

    indent -i4 -nfca -nprs -npcs -npsl -bli0 -nut -br -brs -ce -cli4 -ncs *.c

Sourcefile Organisation
-----------------------
- includes of system headers
- includes of local headers
- type and constant definitions
- global variables
- static variables
- global functions
- static functions

Please mark global variables within function as extern.

Try to keep the code within function simple and easy to read. If it's required
to do something fancy fir better performance, the code could be made better to
understand if it's commented.
