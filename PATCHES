Coding style
============

The Code is idented by four spaces. For better readability you should put
braces of function blocks in their own line like this.

void do_something(const int counter)
{
    if (counter > 5) {
        fprintf(stdout, "Counter higher than 5");
    } else if {
        /* other code here */
    }
}

If you use 'indent' to reindent your code, following option would fit our style.

    indent -i4 -nfca -nprs -npcs -npsl -bli0 -nut -br -brs -ce -cli4 -ncs *.c

Please mark global variables within function as extern.

For now we prefer to write none static function in the first part of file, the
static function into the second part. For a better overview it's recomended to
write all function prototypes for functions.

Try to keep the code within function simple and easy to read. If it's required
to do something fancy fir better performance, the code could be made better to
understand if it's commented.
