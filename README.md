# Nyancat-console

Nyancat-console should be a lightweight port of the 'nyancat lost in space'
flash game that sucks much.

## Setup

Nyancat-console uses ncurses for the terminal rendering stuff so you have to
install the header files. For debian bases systems you can install it via

    sudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev

Compile and run the game:

    make; src/nyancat

## Help out!

I'm far from being an c expert or a game developer, in fact I'm a beginner.
This is my first console game project. So if you have ideas how to make things
better and easier to read, don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!
